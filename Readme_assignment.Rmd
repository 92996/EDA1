Included are the scripts that generate the plots and the corresponding outputs as png files.
Please note that for R versions prior to 3.1.3 sourcing ```library("ggplot2")``` causes an error/warning and in the end nothing is either plotted or saved. To circumvent this just load ggplot2 in 
the console and source the script except for that line.

To optimize multiple runs the script checks the environment and avoids unnecessary calculations. It also calculates the memory usage of the two first two big data frames.

The script plot4.R includes the function "multiplot" that I have downloaded from:

and I thank the author. It's been very useful.
